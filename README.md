# React boilerplate with Webpack, Typescript and Jest configurations

## ðŸš€ About

At the first job as a developer, the senior developer I was working with told me a React developer should have his own boilerplate with Webpack configuration.

Here is my React boilerplate with Webpack, Typescript and Jest configurations. I hope this will come handy to some developer that want to have a boilerplate **without using** `create-react-app`.
